# Lepidoptera-VisionMuse
This project is focused on developing and deploying a computer vision model to use a big image dataset of musuem specimens of butterflies McGuire Lepidoptera Center at UF Gainseville. The goal of this project is is use this model to automate body size estimations using images to answer questions regarding phenotypic variation across geographic and temporal scales.

Current directory contains a sub module called "mothra" which includes details of the vision model developed to quantify body size from the image dataset.
